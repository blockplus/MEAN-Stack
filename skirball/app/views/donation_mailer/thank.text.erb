Dear <%= @donation.purchase.first_name %>,

Thank you for your generous gift of <%= number_to_currency @donation.amount %> to The Temple Emanu-El Skirball Center.

Skirball offers a rich variety of courses every semester, making sure that students of varied backgrounds find a home for Jewish learning, with a community of learners who  openly and honestly explore the ideas that make Judaism a vibrant and meaningful tradition.

As is the case with any school, tuition covers only 25% of the cost of maintaining our Skirball program. Therefore it is people like you – our dedicated learners and supporters – who are making the real difference in helping us to keep Skirball a thriving and vital institution.

Again, thank you for your support.  It means much to me and the organization as a whole.

L’Shalom,

Dr. Gady Levy
Executive Director
