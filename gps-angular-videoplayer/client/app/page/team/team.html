                        About us</h2>
                    <p class="lead"><strong>Say Hello to the MondayReplay Team!</strong>
                        MondayReplay comes out thanks to the passion of three friends who love to go out doing sports and film their feats with a <strong>GoPro.</strong> Although the exciting opportunity GoPro cameras give to live again their own adventures, they realized there was no suitable space to upload and share
                        their videos, often left covered in cobwebs inside their SDs or into their laptops. From the will to share unique moments with <strong>friends</strong> or with the extreme sports community, the idea of MondayReplay arises, a platform that GoPro videos can call their home. A single space where to
                        upload videos, <strong>create clips and highlights </strong>out of them and share the best moments with friends or other adventurers. An idea conceived by GoPro heroes for GoPro heroes. </p>

                    <p class="lead">I am <strong>Manes</strong> and my favourite weekend is kayaking on Saturdays with my laid-back kayak friends and going backcountry on Sundays with friends from the local Alpine club who love to sweat. I have a Gopro Hero3 Black and I use it to edit and upload to Vimeo some 60 videos
                        a year. No more :) Now I get home Saturday night, dump the content of the gopro onto dropbox and I pick up my rucksack and head for a 5 am wakeup call on Sunday. I love Gps and maps, I track with a Suunto logger and I have a water-proof Sony handy with Sd-card to upload on the move.</p>

                    <p class="lead">I am <strong>Franz</strong> and my favourite day is with my friends, windsurfing in the north of Italy... or even better, once a year, the three days trip we organize to discover and taste a famous windsurfing spot. I had a GroPro but it disappeared in the sea... so now I record with
                        the Qumox. Anyway editing video was always a nightmare for me. My friends started asking for video when the adrenaline peak was gone and I was dreaming a bed. Now I can go home, connect the camera to my laptop, upload the session on Dropbox, and have my friends happy to cut instantly the clips
                        where they were recorded (or where I crashed) while I am sleeping :)</p>
