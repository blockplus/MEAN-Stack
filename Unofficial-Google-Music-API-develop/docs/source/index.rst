gmusicapi: an unofficial API for Google Play Music
==================================================

This library allows control of
`Google Music <http://music.google.com>`__ with Python.

.. code-block:: python

    from gmusicapi import Api
    api = Api()
    api.login('user@gmail.com', 'my-password')
    # => True

    library = api.get_all_songs()
    sweet_tracks = [track for track in library if track['artist'] == 'The Cat Empire']

    playlist_id = api.create_playlist('Rad muzak')
    api.change_playlist(playlist_id, sweet_tracks)
    

**This project is not supported nor endorsed by Google.**
Use common sense (protocol compliance, reasonable load, etc) and don't ruin the fun
for everyone else.
